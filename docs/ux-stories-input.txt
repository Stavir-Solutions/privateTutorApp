I am building two android apps for teachers to connect with parents. These apps is targetted at teachers and coaches who provide private coaching and tution and the students parents. Teachers can do the following features 1. manage batches and its students, 2. create assignemnts and share, 3. message parents and recieve messages from parents, 4. manages and share notes including multimedia 5. track the fee payment and send notifications and share test results and get it attested. I want to write UX stories for these apps starting from teacher app.
First screen is the login page, teachers can enter user name and password to sign in. Also there should be an option to signup. The page should also contain the product name and branding log. Can you write ux story


next lets write the story for sign up screen, this screen is accessible if the user clicks on the sign up option in the login screen.
the fields in the pages are
1. Fist Name
2. Last Name 
3. Username - autogenerated recommendation based on firstname and lastname
4. password - minimum 8 characters with on uppercase and one symbol
5. phonenumber - mandatory, validate
6. email - optional, validate
7. profile pic upload - upto 1 mb file
8. Address - mandatory
9. pincode - mandatory
10. gendar - not mandatory
11. signup botton

on click of signup validate the fields and if ok proceed
Once successful go to home page. if failed stay back at the same page
on back go to the history. back

next lets focus on batch management , batches view page
teachers can create and manage batches using the app. Users can access batches from the burger menu on any other common menu. This option need not be in home page since it is not a frequest operation.
In the batches page we will  display the batch details as cards with vertical scrolling. The cards will have only basic and most important information. Teacher can click on a card which will expand to a view with all the option in edit mode and a save button.

All fields of a batch are
name - mandatory
course - optional
subject - optional
description - optional text area
create on - automatic
Fee - float number mandatory - 0 allowed
fee payment frequency - monthly or onetime
payment date - optional if onetime, mandatory if monthly a number selector between 1 and 31

the user can change the field and click on save . If there is error show the error and stay on the page. if save is successful go back to card view. on back go back to card view

The batches view page will also have a create option, on clicking that it will lead the teacher to the create batches screen

now lets do the create batches screen
The create batches screen will have all the same fields as the edit batch screen. With a create button. If there are errors show errors and stay back. If create is success then go back to view batches page and refresh the cards. on clicking back button, go back to the view batches screen


each card in the view batches screen will also have a delete option. when user clicks on delete then show an alert that 'all the notes, assignments and fee payment information will be removed if you do this. Do you really want to go ahead? ' If the user clicks on yes delete the branch and refresh the view batches scfreen. if user clicks on  go back go back to the view batches screen


Now lets create the home page. The home page will be the default screen of the app as long as the user session is active. 
the home page of the app will have the following information 
1. A header from where user can access a menu that has the infrequent options like manage batches and manage profile. Header will also have prominement display of the batch name and an option to change the batch. header will also include a notification icon with the count of unread notifications. On clicking the notifications it will lead to a notification view page. we will have a separte story for taht screen. on clicking the mnanage batches option it goes to view batches screen. on clicking the profile option it goes to the edit profile screen
2. A set of cards that displays the important features of the app. students, assignments, notes, fee tracker and tests. each card can have a summary informatiion say (number of students). Each cardwill be showing the summary in the context of the selected class from header. Each cardwill be clickable and it will lead to corresponding screen
3. on clicking the back button the app closes

In case if the user has not created any batch yet, show a notifiction to create batch. On clicking the notification it should go to create batches screen
